        <p><b>Grammark Version 3.0 CLAWS (Concise Language and Academic Writing Suggestions)</b> is a writing tool intended to assist students with their academic writing—specifically persuasive essays common to first-year writing courses and introductory courses in other subject areas. The system points out potential problems with wording, style, grammar, et cetera, and provides suggestions for improvement. By evaluating each specific suggestion generated by Grammark, students can improve their writing by implementing those suggestions they find to be accurate and helpful. 
        <p>. Due to the nature of both written language and language checking software tools, the Grammark system cannot always differentiate between proper and improper uses of certain words and phrases, resulting in “false positive” flags for words and phrases that may be used correctly. However, instead of viewing these false positives as a shortcoming of the Grammark system, writers should simply view these checks as opportunities to further evaluate their language choices and move forward with confidence when a suggestion does not apply. <br> These are the basic premises the program follows, in plain language:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><b><mark>Passive voice</mark></b> is harder to read and sometimes obscures meaning. Active voice is clearer and punchier. Grammark highlights all instances of passive voice and suggests how to rewrite them actively.</li>
            <li><b><mark>Wordiness.</mark></b> Don't use 3 words when you can say the same thing with 1. Grammark has a database of 973 wordy phrases, like with respect to, a considerable amount of, and as a matter of fact. It finds these and offers concise alternatives (concerning, many, in fact).</li>
            <li><b><mark>Sentence length</mark></b> correlates with sophistication of thought. Writing with many short sentences is usually simplistic, while preponderantly long sentences suggest convoluted thought, and if sentences are all about the same length, writing sounds soporific. Grammark provides a sentence variety score (using standard deviation) and average words per sentence.</li>
            <li><b><mark>Transitions</mark></b> help organize ideas. Text with few transitions is hard to follow. Based on analysis, writing that has less than 1 transition per every 4 sentences may be confusing. Grammark checks your document for 188 common transition words.</li>
            <li><b><mark>Academic Style.</mark></b> As a college writing teacher, I often find myself scribbling "be more specific" or "be more tentative" on student essays. Grammark checks your document against for casual or extreme language.</li>
            <li><b><mark>Nominalizations.</mark></b> Non-root form words (e.g., improvement or improving instead of improve), when overused, can bog down writing. Grammark highlights words with common nominalized endings ("-ization", "-ability", etc.) so you can pinpoint unnecessarily dense sentences.</li>
            <li><b>Grammar</b> is, quite simply, a bunch of rules writers follow. As a teacher, I've spent many a Saturday correcting grammar. Grammark searches for 6,239 errors in about 0.144 seconds.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>There are many more rules of grammar thumb: prepositions at the ends of phrases should be dealt with, to usually avoid split infinitives, and following parallel structure. But many of these have exceptions, and I felt including checks for them would make the tool less efficient and consequently less useful.</p>

          <h2>Make the Project Better</h2>
          <p>The grammark database has 7,060 grammar rules currently, not including algorithms for identifying passive voice and analyzing sentences. Help improve the comprehensiveness of this tool by adding more grammar rules. Go to the submission form and enter a grammar error. If it doesn't yet exist, it will be added to the database after approval.</p>

        <p>The original Grammark open-source web application was created by software developer and former English teacher <a href="https://markfullmer.com/">Mark Fullmer</a>. This original version can still be found at grammark.org.</p>

        <p>In the fall of 202 Jason Palmer (English Instructor, Georgia Gwinnett College) sought to adapt and add to the Grammark tool for his composition students. He and a team of software development students at GGC, were able to add dozens of specific checks to the system and update the user interface, creating Grammark Version 2.0. They also updated the tool from Angular1 to Angular 10. In the spring of 2022, Palmer and a new team of GGC students created the current version of the tool, adding more checks, refining the identification of existing checks, and further improving both aesthetics and user experience.</p>
